# Dependencies

- `bash`, `curl`, `tar`, and [POSIX utilities](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/idx/utilities.html).
- A recent version of Ruby installed by [asdf-ruby](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-ruby)
  - It needs to be set up globally; after installing with `asdf install ruby latest`, also run `asdf global ruby latest`
  - I'm not a Ruby dev; I won't test how this behaves on a system with Ruby installed in other ways.

# Install

Plugin:

```shell
asdf plugin add bashly
# or
asdf plugin add bashly https://github.com/pcrockett/asdf-bashly.git
```

bashly:

```shell
# Show all installable versions
asdf list-all bashly

# Install specific version
asdf install bashly latest

# Set a version globally (on your ~/.tool-versions file)
asdf global bashly latest

# Now bashly commands are available
bashly --version
```

Check [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) readme for more instructions on how to
install & manage versions.
